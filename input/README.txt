## STRUCTURE OF THIS FOLDER

## DOWNLOADED are zip files and other things emailed or shared with me on the PSTAT gdrive. They are for archival purposes only and have not been modified

## RAW_DATA are copied versions of datafiles from the DOWNLOADED folder, retaining their original structure and filenames. The only change is they've been sorted into
subfolders based on the type of data involved. Note that one such folder is the SS files for the WC 2019 assessment, which were worked with using dataprep.R to
fill in gaps for WC data. When values/information was shared via email, PDFs of those communications are included in the relevant folder (unfortunately).

## INPUT_DATA is the sink for dataprep.R, which contains the files to be read by the OM data generation scripts (e.g. load_data_seasons.R).
