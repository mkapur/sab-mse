# Objectives

+ Provide overview of Operating Model design (beta, obviously)
+ Discuss assumptions, data inputs & treatment


???
This is the reference for a dialogue (I'm not the only one talking)
Everything here is in doc; there are several places that aren't super fleshed out
---

# Outline
.inverse[Ground Floor OR the 30,000 foot view]
+ OM Spatial Structure
+ Data Inputs

--

.inverse[Data Generation] & .inverse[OM Conditioning]

+ What gets produced, how, and why
+ Walk-through equations for dynamics and likelihoods from document 
+ Discuss as we go (interrupt me  `r emo::ji("smile")`)

???
Don't forget that it is easy to add n selex curves, harder to change the array structure

# .inverse[Ground Floor]

---
# Ground Floor

+ OM is run in `R` 
+ Conditioning/estimation happens in `TMB` 
+ We are `not` shooting to replicate Stock Synthesis (etc.) exactly in structure nor estimated quantities 


???
For example, R scripts pre-process the data, but TMB code uses that data to produce an expected Numbers-at-age matrix, estimate parameters, etc, then pass back to R for plotting
---
# Spatial Structure
+ A little more complicated than expected (Figure 1)

![](img/Fig1_Strata_Panel.PNG)

--

+ Let's walk through how these came about

---

# Spatial Structure

```{r, echo = -1, eval = TRUE, out.height=400, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Fig1_strata_mapsA.png")
```

???

Also -- Space is confusing, so let's abstract these 
---

# Management Regions

```{r, echo = -1, eval = TRUE, out.height=400, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Fig1_strata_mapsA2.png")
```

???
Simple lines for illustration -- not spatially ok
we trust that everything accuring to AK happens in that box

---
## Stock (demography)

```{r, echo = -1, eval = TRUE, out.height=400, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Fig1_strata_mapsB.png")
```

???
overlaying these strata gives many splices, but some can be ignored


---

## Sub-Areas (what's modeled)

```{r, echo = -1, eval = TRUE, out.height=400, out.width= 500}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Fig1_strata_mapsC.png")
```
???
the union of those two = this, finest strata

---


### Putting it all together (fleets + surveys)

![](img/Fig1_Strata_Panel.PNG)

that was RHS of F1
LHS is a schematic showing how information flows -- you can see how it's important to keep track

next up is what happens where -- but pause for any questions

The last thing I want to add is about survey fleets; those involved with my sptl temporal std work know that i developed a novel index usting VAST. this means that i actually have unique "survey fleets" for each region which are composites

## Approach
+ Template Model Builder w/ modular structure (see SAM)
+ Starter equations under "Likelihood Components", page 13
+ Let's discuss general objectives, and get into details in tandem with dynamics
---
# Model Conditioning
## Objectives
+ Fit the input data
+ Roughly reproduce trends from regional assessments

--

+ .inverse[others?]

???
On the "reproduce" point, I am not positive how well matched it will be dependong on movement outcomes
I can certainly see place for a validation step w movement off

In the dynamics section, when I walk thru equations I will include standout likelihood issues/estimation questions

**Eq 5**
+ Unlike SS, no growth "morphs"
+ Only matters if moving to a new stock
+ Incoming fish influence $L^i_a$ similar to plus-group

???
If fish moves to a new sub-area, it influences the mean length in that sub-area, then obtains growth patterns & corresponding movement probabilities from its sub-area $i$ of residence

Theoretically this could induce shrinkage, but hopefully most of the movement isn't north to south which would cause this to happen.
Part of the rationale is that we would otherwise need to track individual growth histories and end up with an IBM like situation: if fish from A1 move to B2 then a bunch move to C2 etc. Instead, the new movement probs AND growth patterns are shared for everyone extant in sub-area i.
